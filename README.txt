This program requires the 'tweepy' module. 

To get it run "pip install tweepy"

This program asks the user how many tweets he or she would like to stream.
After inputing a number N the program will stream until it reaches N tweets.
From there the program does some math to see what the most popular show was based on those N tweets.
It will create a text file called twitter_data.txt where it compares the number of tweets talking about Game of Thrones vs. Scandal vs. House of Cards.
The text file also contains the tweets and a timestamp for those tweets as well as how long it took to complete the stream.
